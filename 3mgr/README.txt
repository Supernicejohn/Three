Three - the CC project loader.

Tired of having files too large in a project?
Let Three link all your code together while providing
a good sense of structure.
For those familiar with Java, you'll enjoy that
all your code goes into a 'com' table!
Simply retrieve the Three environment in all files
that need access, and enjoy several tools for 
loading, events, and logging that will ease
development and release.

Three can be bundled out with your program so that
your code runs the same way in your development
environment as it does for the end user. 
It can also be told to build your project into
one large file for easy distribution on for example
pastebin. (This process is obfuscation-less)

To set up some basic tools, run threeinstaller in
the tools directory. This will add some cl utils
useful for creating, testing, and managing projects.
(threeinstaller does not need to be bundled with
either type of release as no tools provided should
be used at normal program execution.)
